abstract="We show that the stability requirement for a verication system yields the necessity of some sort of a reflection mechanism. However, the traditional reflection rule based on the G{\"o}odel implicit provability predicate leads to a ``reflection tower'' of theories which cannot be formally veried. We found natural lower and upper bounds on a metatheory capable of establishing stability of a given verication system. The paper also introduces an explicit reflection mechanism which can be veri ed internally. This circumvents the reflection tower and provides a theoretical justication for the verication process. On the practical side, the paper gives specic recommendations concerning verication of inference rules and building a veriable reflection mechanism for a theorem proving system.",

abstract="A novel pattern mining algorithm and a novel formal definition of surprisingness are introduced, both framed in the context of formal reasoning. Hypergraphs are used to represent the data in which patterns are mined, the patterns themselves, and the control rules for the pattern miner. The implementation of these tools in the OpenCog framework, as part of a broader multi-algorithm approach to AGI, is described.",
