abstract="We show that the stability requirement for a verication system yields the necessity of some sort of a reflection mechanism. However, the traditional reflection rule based on the G{\"o}odel implicit provability predicate leads to a ``reflection tower'' of theories which cannot be formally veried. We found natural lower and upper bounds on a metatheory capable of establishing stability of a given verication system. The paper also introduces an explicit reflection mechanism which can be veri ed internally. This circumvents the reflection tower and provides a theoretical justication for the verication process. On the practical side, the paper gives specic recommendations concerning verication of inference rules and building a veriable reflection mechanism for a theorem proving system.",

publisher = {World Scientific Publishing Co., Inc.},
address = {USA},
abstract = {This book provides a systematic and comprehensive description of Non-Axiomatic Logic, which is the result of the author's research for about three decades. Non-Axiomatic Logic is designed to provide a uniform logical foundation for Artificial Intelligence, as well as an abstract description of the "laws of thought" followed by the human mind. Different from "mathematical" logic, where the focus is the regularity required when demonstrating mathematical conclusions, Non-Axiomatic Logic is an attempt to return to the original aim of logic, that is, to formulate the regularity in actual human thinking. To achieve this goal, the logic is designed under the assumption that the system has insufficient knowledge and resources with respect to the problems to be solved, so that the "logical conclusions" are only valid with respect to the available knowledge and resources. Reasoning processes according to this logic covers cognitive functions like learning, planning, decision making, problem solving, etc. This book is written for researchers and students in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science, and can be used as a textbook for courses at graduate level, or upper-level undergraduate, on Non-Axiomatic Logic. Readership: Students and professionals interested in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.}
