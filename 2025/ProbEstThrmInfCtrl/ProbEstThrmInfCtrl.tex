\section{Introduction}

In this paper we show how to estimate the probability of a proposition
to be provable given all available evidence by using Probabilistic
Logic Networks (PLN)~\cite{Goertzel09PLN}.  We then explain how such
estimation can be used as guiding heuristics for Automated Theorem
Proving (ATP).

The idea is to define a ternary predicate holding the relationship
between theory, proof and theorem.  Given its semi-decidable nature,
under finite resources, we cannot hope to establish whether such
relationship hold for any argument.  We can however hope to estimate,
with various degrees of confidence, the probability that it may or may
not hold given the available evidence.  For instance, a piece of
evidence in favor of
$$\forall x \ P(x)$$ could be that $P$ holds for some $a$.  Ideally
every bit of information that relates to the conjecture should be
taken into account to estimate its probability of being a theorem.
Although only having an actual proof, or an actual contradiction, can
establish certainty.  Moreover, such ability can then be used as a
guide to discover proofs by prioritizing the search over lemmas that
are themselves more likely to be provable.  The same idea can be
applied recursively on these lemmas till it bottoms out by reaching
the axioms, or a contradiction.

NEXT: add quick state of the art.

\section{Relating Theory, Proof and Proposition in PLN}

From a type theoretic perspective, propositions are types, theories
are collections of typing relationships and proofs are terms
inhabiting types.  Let us define a ternary predicate $\U$,
representing such relationship
$$\U : \Theory \times \Proof \times \Proposition \arrow \Bool$$ where
$\Theory$ is a set of collections of typing relationships encoding the
axioms and inference rules of each theory, $\Proof$ is a set of terms
representing proofs, and $\Proposition$ is a set of types representing
propositions.  The content of $\U$ can already be characterized in PLN
by formalizing rewriting laws within such type system.  For instance
modus ponens could be represented as\footnote{Note that due to PLN
being in a state of rework, the syntax used here is provisional.}
$$\U(\Gamma, f, a \to b) \land \U(\Gamma, x, a) \limp \U(\Gamma, f(x),
b)\ \measeq\ \STV{1}{1}$$ where $\Gamma$, $f$, $x$, $a$ and $b$ are
universally quantified variables, $\to$ is an implication at the
object level, $\measeq$ relates a PLN \emph{statement}, here an
implication at the logical level $\limp$, to a \emph{truth value},
here $\STV{1}{1}$, forming a PLN \emph{judgment} capturing the
uncertainty of the statement.  The first number of the truth value
represents the strength and the second number represents the
confidence over that strength, although underneath, a truth value
represents a second order distribution.  In the example above the
judgment is certain because both the strength and the confidence are
1.  The full judgment can be read as: in theory $\Gamma$, if $f$ is a
proof of $a \arrow b$, and $x$ is a proof of $a$, then with certainty
$f(x)$ is a proof of $b$.  In addition, PLN allows to reason about
uncertain knowledge via induction and abduction.  Given a corpus of
examples (and counter examples) of $\Theta$, induction can be used to
gather statistics about the probability of some propositions meeting
some criteria to be theorems.

Given a theory $\Gamma$ and a proposition $C$, the question \emph{what
is the probability that there exists a proof $p$ of $C$ in $\Gamma$?}
can be formulated by the following PLN query
$$\exists p\ \U(\Gamma, p, C)\ \measeq\ \$\texttt{tv}$$ where
$\$\texttt{tv}$ is a hole corresponding to the truth value to be
filled by PLN.  The way this truth value is calculated may involve
both crisp logical reasoning and statistical reasoning, the latter
including recognizing patterns relating theories, proofs and
propositions.
%% Thus given
%% $$\U(\Gamma, pa, P(a))\ \measeq\ \True$$
%% $$\U(\Gamma, pb, P(b))\ \measeq\ \True$$
%% $$\vdots$$
%% one can infer
%% $$\U(\Gamma, p, \forall x\ P(x))\ \measeq\ \True$$

\section{Provability Estimation as Guiding Heuristic}




Even though it looks like solving a problem (i.e. proving theorems in
crisp theories) a by having to solve even bigger problems
(i.e. proving theorems in PLN), PLN is part of $\Theta$.
