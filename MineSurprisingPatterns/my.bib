abstract="Fishgram, a novel algorithm for recognizing frequent or otherwise interesting sub-hypergraphs in large, heterogeneous hypergraphs, is presented. The algorithm's implementation the OpenCog integrative AGI framework is described, and concrete examples are given showing the patterns it recognizes in OpenCog's hypergraph knowledge store when the OpenCog system is used to control a virtual agent in a game world. It is argued that Fishgram is well suited to fill a critical niche in OpenCog and potentially other integrative AGI architectures: scalable recognition of relatively simple patterns in heterogeneous, potentially rapidly-changing data.",

abstract="Pattern mining is one of the most important aspects of data mining. By far the most popular and well-known approach is frequent pattern mining. That is, to discover patterns that occur in many transactions. This approach has many virtues including monotonicity, which allows efficient discovery of all frequent patterns. Nevertheless, in practice frequent pattern mining rarely gives good results---the number of discovered patterns is typically gargantuan and they are heavily redundant.",

We introduce four synergistic update algorithms that use a Stochastic Context-Free Grammar as a guiding probability distribution of programs. The update algorithms accomplish adjusting production probabilities, re-using previous solutions, learning programming idioms and discovery of frequent subprograms. A controlled experiment with a long training sequence shows that our incremental learning approach is effective.",
