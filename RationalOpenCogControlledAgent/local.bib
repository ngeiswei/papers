abstract="A specialization of Solomonoff Operator Induction considering partial operators described by second order probability distributions, and more specifically Beta distributions, is introduced. An estimate to predict the second order probability of new data, obtained by averaging the second order distributions of partial operators, is derived. The problem of managing the partiality of the operators is presented. A simplistic solution based on estimating the Kolmogorov complexity of perfect completions of partial operators is given.",

abstract = {We discuss a variant of Thompson sampling for nonparametric reinforcement learning in countable classes of general stochastic environments. These environments can be non-Markov, non-ergodic, and partially observable. We show that Thompson sampling learns the environment class in the sense that (1) asymptotically its value converges to the optimal value in mean and (2) given a recoverability assumption regret is sublinear.},
