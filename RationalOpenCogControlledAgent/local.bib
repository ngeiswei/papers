abstract="A specialization of Solomonoff Operator Induction considering partial operators described by second order probability distributions, and more specifically Beta distributions, is introduced. An estimate to predict the second order probability of new data, obtained by averaging the second order distributions of partial operators, is derived. The problem of managing the partiality of the operators is presented. A simplistic solution based on estimating the Kolmogorov complexity of perfect completions of partial operators is given.",

We show that Thompson sampling learns the environment class in the sense that (1) asymptotically its value converges to the optimal value in mean and (2) given a recoverability assumption regret is sublinear.},

abstract = {AGI systems should be able to pursue their many goals autonomously while operating in realistic environments which are complex, dynamic, and often novel. This paper discusses the theory and mechanisms for goal generation and management in Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS). NARS works to accomplish its goals by performing executable actions while integrating feedback from its experience to build subjective, but useful, predictive and meaningful models. The system’s ever-changing knowledge allows it to adaptively derive new goals from its existing goals. Derived goals not only serve to accomplish their parent goals but also represent independent motivation. The system determines how and when to pursue its many goals based on priority, context, and knowledge acquired from its experience and reasoning capabilities.},

address = {NLD},
abstract = {A teaching methodology called Imitative-Reinforcement-Corrective (IRC) learning is described, and proposed as a general approach for teaching embodied non-linguistic AGI systems. IRC may be used with a variety of different learning algorithms, but it is particularly easily described in EC lingo. In these terms, it is a framework for automatically learning a procedure that generates a desired type of behavior, in which: a set of exemplars of the target behavior-type are utilized for fitness estimation; reinforcement signals from a human teacher are used for fitness evaluation; and the execution of candidate procedures may be modified by the teacher via corrections delivered in real-time. An example application of IRC to teach behaviors to AI-controlled artificial animals embodied in the Second Life virtual world is described in detail, including a review of the overall virtual-animal-control software architecture and how the integrative teaching/learning methodology fits into it. In this example application architecture, the learning algorithm may be toggled between hillclimbing and probabilistic evolutionary learning. Envisioned future applications are also discussed, including an application to embodied language learning applicable to agents in Second Life and other virtual worlds.},

Our preliminary results suggest that, while PLN can address these problems adequately, ECAN offers little added value for the problems in their standard form. However, we outline modified versions of the problem that we hypothesize would demonstrate the value of ECAN more effectively, via inclusion of confounding information that needs to be heuristically sifted through.",
