\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to make an agent as rational as possible,
not necessarily as efficient as possible.  This stems from the concern
that in order to autonomously gain efficiency the agent must first be
able to make the best possible decisions, starting first in the outer
world, and then in the inner world.

% Inner actions could be as transitory as bringing a piece of
% knowledge to the attentional focus, and as profound as rewriting a
% part of its code, like a Goedel Machine.  The atomspace can be
% viewed as a very compact representation of an envelop over
% environments (cite partial operator induction paper).  And PLN can
% be viewed as an abstract-enabling way to calculate the cumulative
% reward (in case it is used as a re-inforcement learner) to be
% maximized, or a goal driven agent in a more general case.  For these
% reasons ROCCA may well be seen as an approximated combination of
% AI\Xi and a Goedel Machine.

The paper presents

The agent starts in a completely unknown environment

The idea is that reasoning is used at all levels, discovering patterns
from raw observations, building plans and making decisions.

It is a work in progress.

Neural networks are excellent at interpolation, but are rather poor at
extrapolation, what we need for true intelligence is a system that
thinks critically.

Rarely do causes and effects take place over arbitrary temporal
scales.  For instance it is unlikely to find a cause that may produce
the same effect, or an effect at all, after 1ms, 1 century or any time
in between.  For that reason we focus on a real time temporal logic.

\section{Recall: Probabilistic Logic Networks}

PLN, which stands for Probabilistic Logic Networks, is a mixture of
predicate and term logic that has been probabilitized to properly
handle uncertainty.  It has two types of rules
\begin{enumerate}
\item one type for introducing relationships from direct observations,
\item the other for introducing relationships from existing
  relationships.
\end{enumerate}
As such it is especially suited for building an ongoing understanding
of an unknown environment (using direct introduction rules), and then
planning in that environment (using indirect introduction rules).

\subsection{Elementary Notions}

%% Let us first recall the minimum portion of PLN we will need to
%% describe the temporal logic used in this paper.

% ==========================================
%
% Random field => spatial reasoning
% Stochastic process => temporal reasoning
% |-
% Temporal index = any total order
% Spacial index = any topology
%
% TODO: express Allen's interval relations into TPLN
%
% ==========================================

% TODO: discuss emerging temporal reasoning from non temporal reasoning

Graphically speaking, PLN statements are
sub-hypergraphs\footnote{because links can point to links, not just
nodes} made of links and nodes, called \emph{Atoms}, decorated with
\emph{Truth Values} that can be understood as uncertain probabilities
\cite{TODO}.  Syntactically speaking however, PLN statements are not
very different from statements expressed in another logic, except that
they are usually formatted in prefixed-operator indented-argument
style to emphasize their graphical nature and leave room for truth
values.  There is a large variety of constructs for PLN, here we will
focus primarily on constructs for manipulating predicates.  Let us
recall that predicates are functions that take tuples of Atoms and
output boolean values
$$P, Q, R, \hdots: \TAtom^n \mapsto \{\TTrue, \TFalse\}$$
Predicate constructs can be grouped in two classes of operators
\begin{enumerate}
\item one for defining predicate from instances, such as $\TEval$ and
  $\TLamb$,
\item and another for combining existing predicates, such as $\TAnd$,
  $\TOr$ and $\TNot$ (obtained by lifting their pointwise counterparts
  to the predicate domain), and $\TImpl$ (for representing conditional
  probabilities).
\end{enumerate}
Let us present these operators below, corresponding to the minimum
subset we will need in the rest of the paper.
\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluation:
  $$
  \begin{array}{l}
    \TEval\ \TBTV\\
    \SP P\\
    \SP E\\
  \end{array}
  $$
  states that $P(E)$ outputs $\TTrue$ to a degree set by the truth value
  $\TTV$.
\item Lambda:
  $$
  \begin{array}{l}
    \TLamb\ \TBTV\\
    \SP x\\
    \SP P(x)\\
  \end{array}
  $$
  is a predicate constructor with variable $x$ and predicate body
  $P(x)$, where the true value $\TTV$ corresponds to the probability
  $\prob(P)$ of $P(x)$ to output $\TTrue$ for a random input.
\item Conjunction:
  $$
  \begin{array}{l}
    \TAnd\ \TBTV\\
    \SP P\\
    \SP Q\\
  \end{array}
  $$
  represents the predicate obtained by taking the conjunction of
  $P$ and $Q$, or equivalently the indicator function corresponding to
  the intersection of the \emph{satisfying sets} of $P$ and $Q$.
  The truth value $\TTV$ then represents an estimate of the
  probability $\prob(P,Q)$ of the conjunction of $P$ and $Q$.
\item Negation:
  $$
  \begin{array}{l}
    \TNot\ \TBTV\\
    \SP P\\
  \end{array}
  $$
  represents the negation of $P$, or equivalently the indicator
  function corresponding to the complement of the satisfying set of
  $P$. The truth value $\TTV$ then represents an estimate of
  the probability $\prob(\neg P)$ of the negation of $P$.
\item Implication:
  $$
  \begin{array}{l}
    \TImpl\ \TBTV\\
    \SP P\\
    \SP Q\\
  \end{array}
  $$
  represents the predicate $Q$ conditioned on $P$, that is only
  defined for instances $x$ for which $P(x)$ is $\TTrue$.  The truth
  value $\TTV$ then represents an estimate of the conditional
  probability $\prob(Q|P)$.  There is some subtleties to take
  into account due to the fact $P(x)$ can actually be partially true
  (stated by the truth values of $\TEval$ links as explained above),
  but this resolves nicely by assuming degrees of truth are
  probabilistic.  More is explained about that below.
\end{itemize}
Truth values are fundamentally second order probability
distributions. However in practice they are usually represented by two
numbers, a strength and a confidence, both ranging from 0 to 1.  The
strength represents a probability while the confidence represents a
precision over that probability.  Underneath, strength and confidence
can be mapped into a second order distribution such as a Beta
distribution [TODO: add figure].  TODO: cite Subjective Logic and
Chapt 4 of the PLN book.

\subsection{Inference Rules}

Beside operators, inferences rules are used to construct PLN
statements and calculate their truth values.  They mainly fall into
two categories, direct and indirect.  Direct rules infer abstract
knowledge from direct evidence, while indirect rules infer knowledge
by combining existing abstractions, themselves inferred directly or
indirectly.  There are dozens of inference rules but for now we will
only recall two which are needed for the paper:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Implication Direct Introduction Rule}
\item \emph{Deduction Rule}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Implication Direct Introduction Rule (IDI)} takes $\TEval$
links as premises and produces an $\TImpl$ link as conclusion,
formally depicted by the following proof tree
{\scriptsize
\begin{prooftree}
  \AxiomC{$
    \begin{array}{l}
      \TEval\ \TBTVPi\\
      \SP P\\
      \SP E_i\\
    \end{array}
    $}
  \AxiomC{$\hdots$}
  \AxiomC{$
    \begin{array}{l}
      \TEval\ \TBTVQi\\
      \SP Q\\
      \SP E_i\\
    \end{array}
    $}
  \RightLabel{(IDI)}
  \TrinaryInfC{$
    \begin{array}{l}
      \TImpl\ \TBTV\\
      \SP P\\
      \SP Q\\
    \end{array}
    $}
\end{prooftree}}
Assuming perfectly reliable direct evidence\footnote{Dealing with
unreliable direct evidence involves expensive convolution products and
is outside of the scope of this paper.} then the resulting truth value
is calculated as follows
$$\TTV.\Tstrength = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n f_\wedge(\TTVPi.\Tstrength, \TTVQi.\Tstrength)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \TTVPi.\Tstrength}$$
$$\TTV.\Tconf = \frac{n}{n+k}$$ where $\TTV.\Tstrength$ and
$\TTV.\Tconf$ respectively represent the strength and the confidence
of $\TTV$, $k$ is a system parameter, and $f_\wedge$ is a function
embodying a probabilistic assumption about the intersection of the
events corresponding to the \emph{probabilitized degrees of truth} of
$P(E_i)$ and $Q(E_i)$.  Such function typically ranges from the
product (perfect independence) to the $\min$ (perfect overlap).

\subsubsection{The Deduction Rule (D)} takes two $\TImpl$ links as
premises and produces a third one.  Depending on what assumption is
made there exists different variations of that rule.  The simplest
one, based on the Markov property
$$\prob(R|Q,P) = \prob(R|Q)$$
%% $$\prob(R|\neg Q,P) = \prob(R|\neg Q)$$
can be formally depicted by the following proof tree
{\scriptsize
  \begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$
      \begin{array}{l}
        \TImpl\ \TBTVPQ\\
        \SP P\\
        \SP Q\\
      \end{array}
      $}
    \AxiomC{$
      \begin{array}{l}
        \TImpl\ \TBTVQR\\
        \SP Q\\
        \SP R\\
      \end{array}
      $}
    \AxiomC{$P \TBTVP$}
    \AxiomC{$Q \TBTVQ$}
    \AxiomC{$R \TBTVR$}
    \RightLabel{(D)}
    \QuinaryInfC{$
      \begin{array}{l}
        \TImpl\ \TBTV\\
        \SP P\\
        \SP R\\
      \end{array}
      $}
  \end{prooftree}
}
%%  essentially expressing a probabilitized version of the transitivity
%% of $\TImpl$ with a Markov property
%% $$\prob(R|Q,P) = \prob(R|Q)$$
%% $$\prob(R|\neg Q,P) = \prob(R|\neg Q)$$
The reader may notice that three additional premises have been added,
corresponding to the probabilities $\prob(P)$, $\prob(Q)$ and $\prob(R)$.
This is a consequence of the Markov property.  The exact formula for
that variation will not be recalled\footnote{More information can be
found in \cite{TODO}} here but it merely derives from
$$\prob(R|P) = \prob(R|Q,P)\times\prob(Q|P) + \prob(R|\neg
Q,P)\times\prob(\neg Q|P)$$

\section{Temporal Logic}

The temporal logic define in \cite{TODO} is somewhat partial and
ambiguous.  In that section we provide a possible completion.
%% , showing how the two inference rules recalled
%% above to carry out temporal reasoning.  Let us define that
Let us begin by defining \emph{Temporal Predicates}, also called
\emph{Fluents} as predicates tends to denote atemporal relationships,
as regular predicates with a temporal dimension
$$P, Q, R, \hdots: \TAtom^n \times \TTime \mapsto \{\TTrue,
\TFalse\}$$ $\TTime$ here is considered discrete, formally defined as
a natural number.

\subsection{Temporal Operators}
Given temporal predicates we can now define a small set of temporal
operators.

\subsubsection{$\TLag$ and $\TLead$} are temporal operators to shift the
time dimension of a temporal predicate.  $\TLag$, respectively
$\TLead$, is similar to the metric variation of the \emph{Past}
operator denoted $P_n$, respectively the \emph{Future} operator
denoted $F_n$, of Temporal Logic \cite{Prior 1967, Chapter VI}, with
the distinction that it applies over an expression that evaluates into
a temporal predicate, as opposed to an expression that evaluates into
boolean.

The $\TLag$ operator is formally defined as follows
$$
\begin{array}{l}
  \TLag\\
  \SP P\\
  \SP T\\
\end{array}
$$
:=
$$
\begin{array}{l}
  \TLamb\\
  \SP x_1, ..., x_n, t\\
  \SP P(x_1, ..., x_n, t-T)\\
\end{array}
$$
where the first line of the $\TLamb$ link is the variable
declaration of the temporal predicate and the second line is the body
representing a temporally shifted reconstruction of $P$.  Informally
speaking, the $\TLag$ operator gives a peek into the past, or
equivalently, brings the past into the present.  This is a major
difference with \cite{PLN} that defined sequential and using notions
of the Event Calculus \cite{TODO}.  Here we do not do that (TODO:
maybe such operator should be called PrecedeAnd, or such).  That is
because using this simpler notion of sequential and allows more
flexibility to construct various forms of descriptions of how events
initialization, termination, etc, are sequenced.

The $\TLead$ operator is the inverse of the $\TLag$ operator and is
formally defined as follows
$$
\begin{array}{l}
  \TLead\\
  \SP P\\
  \SP T\\
\end{array}
$$
:=
$$
\begin{array}{l}
  \TLamb\\
  \SP x_1, ..., x_n, t\\
  \SP P(x_1, ..., x_n, t+T)\\
\end{array}
$$ As the inverse of the $\TLag$ operator, the $\TLead$ operator gives
a peek into the future, or equivalently, brings the future into the
present.  Finally, as being the inverse of one another, the following
equivalence holds
$$
\begin{array}{l}
  \TLag\\
  \SP \TLead\\
  \SP \SP P\\
  \SP \SP T\\
  \SP T\\
\end{array}
\equiv
\begin{array}{l}
  P\\
\end{array}
$$

\subsubsection{$\TSeqAnd$} is a temporal conjunction where one of the
temporal predicate arguments have been temporally shifted.  There are
two variations one can define.  A $\TBSeqAnd$ variation where the past
of one of the temporal predicates is brought into the present, using the
$\TLag$ operator, formally defined as
$$
\begin{array}{l}
  \TBSeqAnd\\
  \SP T\\
  \SP P\\
  \SP Q\\
\end{array}
:=
\begin{array}{l}
  \TAnd\\
  \SP \TLag\\
  \SP \SP P\\
  \SP \SP T\\
  \SP Q\\
\end{array}
$$
resulting into a temporal predicate such that in order to be true
at time $t$ requires that $P$ be true at time $t$ and $Q$ be true at
time $t+T$.

Inversely, there is a $\TFSeqAnd$ variation where the future of the
other temporal predicate is brought into the present, formally defined
as
$$
\begin{array}{l}
  \TFSeqAnd\\
  \SP T\\
  \SP P\\
  \SP Q\\
\end{array}
:=
\begin{array}{l}
  \TAnd\\
  \SP P\\
  \SP \TLead\\
  \SP \SP Q\\
  \SP \SP T\\
\end{array}
$$
resulting into a temporal predicate such that in order to be true
at time $t$ requires that $P$ be true at time $t-T$ and $Q$ be true at
time $t$.

Finally one may notice that $\TBSeqAnd$ and $\TFSeqAnd$ equivalent up
to temporal shifting, as follows

NEXT
$$
\begin{array}{l}
  \TBSeqAnd\\
  \SP T\\
  \SP P\\
  \SP Q\\
\end{array}
\equiv
\begin{array}{l}
  \TBSeqAnd\\
  \SP T\\
  \SP P\\
  \SP Q\\
\end{array}
$$

\subsubsection{$\TPredImpl$} likewise defines a temporal implication,
formally
$$
\begin{array}{l}
  \TPredImpl\\
  \SP T\\
  \SP P\\
  \SP Q\\
\end{array}
$$
:=
$$
\begin{array}{l}
  \TImpl\\
  \SP P\\
  \SP \TLead\\
  \SP \SP Q\\
  \SP \SP T\\
\end{array}
$$
resulting into a conditional predicate, that in order to be defined at
time $t$ requires that $P$ be true at time $t$, and in order to be true
at $t$ requires that $Q$ be true at $t+T$.

We now have everything we need to define temporal inference rules, but
before that let us first introduce some notations in order to be
easier to lay out.

\subsection{Notations}

The following notations can afford to ignore truth values, that is
because no new formula is required for temporal reasoning.  All that
is required are the definitions above mapping temporal expressions
into equivalent atemporal ones.  The notations are summarized in the
table below, ranked by syntactic precedence to minimize the number of
required parenthesis.
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  \text{Atomese} & \text{Notation} & \text{Precedence} \\
  \hline
  \TEval(P, \TList(X_1, \dots, X_n)) & P(X_1, \dots, X_n) & 1 \\
  \TLamb(t, \TAtTime(\TExec(A), t)) & \ldo{A} & 1 \\
  \TLag(P, T) & \llag{P}{T} & 1 \\
  \TLead(P, T) & \llead{P}{T} & 1 \\
  \TAnd(P, Q) & P \land Q & 2 \\
  \TOr(P, Q) & P \lor Q & 2 \\
  \TSeqAnd(T, P, Q) & P \lseqand{T} Q & 3 \\
  \TSeqOr(T, P, Q) & P \lseqor{T} Q & 3 \\
  \TImpl(P, Q) & P \limp Q & 4 \\
  \TPredImpl(T, P, Q) & P \lpreimp{T} \! \! Q & 4 \\
  \hline
\end{array}
$$
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}
The precedence of everything else (predicates nodes, etc) is 0.

%% $$

TODO: show examples of notational format with the effect of precedence

\subsection{Temporal Rules}

TODO: $\TPredImpl$ direct introduction.

Given that we can now introduce our temporal rules, (PI), (IP), (S)

TODO: detail (PI), (IP), (S) rules

and the most important one Temporal Deduction (TD)
{\small
  \begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$P \lpreimp{T_1} Q$}
    \AxiomC{$Q \lpreimp{T_2} R$}
    \AxiomC{$P$}
    \AxiomC{$Q$}
    \AxiomC{$R$}
    \RightLabel{(TD)}
    \QuinaryInfC{$P \lpreimp{T_1+T_2} R$}
  \end{prooftree}
}
To determine the formula to calculate the resulting truth value of
such rule, we only need to map such temporal deduction into a regular
deduction as follows

{\tiny
  \begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$P \lpreimp{T_1} Q$}
    \RightLabel{(PI)}
    \UnaryInfC{$P \limp \llead{Q}{T_1}$}
    \AxiomC{$Q \lpreimp{T_2} R$}
    \RightLabel{(PI)}
    \UnaryInfC{$Q \limp \llead{R}{T_2}$}
    \RightLabel{(S)}
    \UnaryInfC{$\llead{Q}{T_1} \limp \llead{R}{T_1+T_2}$}
    \AxiomC{$P$}
    \AxiomC{$Q$}
    \RightLabel{(S)}
    \UnaryInfC{$\llead{Q}{T_1}$}
    \AxiomC{$R$}
    \RightLabel{(S)}
    \UnaryInfC{$\llead{R}{T_1+T_2}$}
    \RightLabel{(D)}
    \QuinaryInfC{$P \limp \llead{R}{T_1+T_2}$}
    \RightLabel{(IP)}
    \UnaryInfC{$P \lpreimp{T_1+T_2} R$}
\end{prooftree}}

\subsection{Procedural Reasoning}

Likewise, we can use the same temporal to regular deduction mapping to
build inference rules for procedural reasoning.  Given two cognitive
schematics
$$P \land \ldo{A} \lpreimp{T_1} Q$$
expressing that executing $A$ in context $P$ likely leads to context
$Q$ after $T_1$ time units, and
$$Q \land \ldo{B} \lpreimp{T_2} R$$
expressing that executing $B$ in context $Q$ likely leads to context
$R$ after $T_2$ time units, the question becomes how to infer the
likelihood that executing $A$ and $B$ in sequence starting from
context $P$ leads to context $R$ after $T_1+T_2$ time units,
corresponding to the cognitive schematic
$$P \land \ldo{A} \lseqand{T_1} \ldo{B} \lpreimp{T_1+T_2} R$$

Using the same rules to map $\TPredImpl$ to regular $\TImpl$ and vice
versa, as well as rules about the $\TLead$ operator, we can construct
the following inference tree, in fact the PLN engine can construct it
for us

{\tiny
  \begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$P\!\land\!\ldo{A} \lpreimp{T_1} Q$}
    \RightLabel{(PI)}
    \UnaryInfC{$P\!\land\!\ldo{A} \limp^{T_1} \llead{Q}{T_1}$}
    \RightLabel{(C)}
    \UnaryInfC{$P\!\land\!\ldo{A}\!\land\!\llead{\ldo{B}}{T_1} \limp
      \llead{Q}{T_1}\!\land\!\llead{\ldo{B}}{T_1}$}
    \AxiomC{$Q\!\land\!\ldo{B} \lpreimp{T_2} R$}
    \RightLabel{(PI)}
    \UnaryInfC{$Q\!\land\!\ldo{B} \limp \llead{R}{T_2}$}
    \RightLabel{(S)}
    \UnaryInfC{$\llead{Q}{T_1}\!\land\!\llead{\ldo{B}}{T_1} \limp
      \llead{R}{T_1+T_2}$}
    %% \AxiomC{$P\!\land\!\ldo{A}$}
    %% \AxiomC{$\llead{\ldo{B}}{T_1}$}

providing an Action Sequence Deduction (ASD) rule ready to be used for
procedural reasoning.  Three additional premises have been added
$P\!\land\!\ldo{A}\!\land\!\llead{\ldo{B}}{T_1}$, $Q\!\land\!\ldo{B}$
and $R$.

\section{Conclusion}

TODO: implement more temporal and procedural rules, support temporal
intervals, behavior trees, introduce Temporal Truth Value.  Integrate
Event Calculus.

Hint regarding intervals: define a notion of parameterized union,
where for temporal interval the parameters would be temporal variables
ranging over intervals.
